## Install

You can install uBlacklist from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublacklist/pncfbmialoiaghdehhbnbhkkgmjanfhe/), [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/ublacklist/) or [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ublacklist-for-safari/id1547912640).

:::note

uBlacklist requires many site permissions upon installation. These permissions are necessary to support all domains where Google Search is provided (e.g., google.com, google.ac, google.ad, ...).
